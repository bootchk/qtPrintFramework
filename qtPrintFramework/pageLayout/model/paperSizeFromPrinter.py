  '''
  Model derived from a real printer.
  
  Show only paper sizes printer supports.
  If model has paper sizes that printer NOT support, when user chooses an unsupported value,
  and setPaperSize() is called, printer refuses to acknowledge (setPaperSize() has no effect), 
  and this framework gets out of sync with printer.
  
  Current implemntation omits all Custom page sizes.

    So this is a subset of Qt's enum.
    
    !!! Alternate design: Custom is in model.
    Here, we are excluding it from this model used only by the framework's Page Setup PDF dialog.
