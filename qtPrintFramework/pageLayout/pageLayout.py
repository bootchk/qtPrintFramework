class PageLayout(QObject, Settingsable):  
  '''
  Persistent user's choice of page layout attributes.
  Basically a QPageLayout (new to Qt5.3) that also persists in settings.
  
  A PageLayout is data, a PageSetup is a dialog or user interaction to edit a PageLayout.
  
  This defines the set of attributes:
  - page size
  - page orientation
  - (currently, we omit margins)
  
  The editor (a dialog) defines the labels and models for attribute controls.
  
  For a CustomPaper, we DO persist user's choice of size for the Custom paper.
  
  Responsibilities:
  - editable via a PageSetupDialog
    (user can also edit a page layout using a native dialog, but that comes here via PrinterAdaptor 
  - save/restore self to settings, so self persists with app, not with a printer
  - apply/get self to/from PrinterAdaptor (via native dialogs.)
  
  Almost a responsibility:
  - edit: a PageSetupDialog edits this, and knows this intimately by iterating over editable PageAttributes.
    But other dialogs (native) contribute to self state.
    See PrintRelatedConverser.
    Editor is also known as control/view.
  
  For some apps, a PageLayout (as a user choice) is an attribute of a document.
  For other apps, a PageLayout is only an attribute of a user (a setting.)
  Here, we always get it as a setting.
  If your app treats a PageLayout as a document attribute,
  you must call toPrinterAdaptor() (but it may not take.)
  
  !!! A PageLayout can be impressed on a PrinterAdaptor, but a PrinterAdaptor does not own one.
  A PrintConverser owns a PageLayout.
  An adapted printer (that a PrinterAdaptor adapts) might own another object (opaque to us) that is its notion of page layout.
  
  !!! Paper/Page are not interchangeable but refer to a similar concept.
  Paper connotes real thing, and Page an ideal concept.
  They are often both confusingly used for the ideal concept (regardless of whether real thing is involved.)

    We only ensure that just before showing dialog.

    That is, we don't force a native printer's pageLayout onto self (on user's preferred pageLayout for document),
    until user actually chooses to print on said native printer.
