This package is about real printers.
It depends on Qt's QPrintSupport module (which might not exist on mobile platforms iOS and Android.)
No other package/modules in qtPrintFramework should depend on QtPrintSupport.
So you can use qtPrintFramework on mobile platforms if you exclude the package 'printer.'
