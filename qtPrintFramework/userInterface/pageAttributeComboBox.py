    See web for much discussion.
     
    lineEdit must be editable to set alignment, but then can be made readOnly
     
    right alignment didn't seem to have desired effect on Linux May 2014.
    right alignment cut off right side of text under scroll bar on Win Vista May 2014 see QTBUG 33176
    
    Apple HIG guidelines don't seem to suggest an alignment.
    But since the widget is left aligned (in a form), might as well left align the items also?
    
    If aligning right, does this help:
    comboBox.view().setLayoutDirection(Qt.RightToLeft)
