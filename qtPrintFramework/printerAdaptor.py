  A thin wrapper around QPrinter:
  - hides Qt's native/nonnative printer distinction
  - adds print PDF for platforms that don't support it (Win).  Linux already supports via Qt or and OSC natively.
  - fixes QTBUG TODO
  
  QPrinter is itself an adaptor/controller: it adapts physical and virtual (e.g. to PDF file) printers.
  
  Responsibilities:
  - hold conversations (dialogs, user interactions) related to printing (Print, PageSetup)
  - know which paper user has chosen
  - know printable rect (taking into account paper, margins, and paper orientation)
  - know user's choice of file (for paperless print)
  - emit signals when user accepts/cancels
  - emit signals when user chooses a different paper

    is the current adapted printer a native printer (driver) ?
    
    Note that QPrinter has state: the printer it is adapting, which can change.
    
    isAdaptingNative() == True:  all Qt dialogs (which may call native dialogs) work with self.
    A native dialog is implemented by the platform, not Qt.
    
    not isAdaptingNative(): the adapted printer is implemented by Qt
    and the page setup dialog is implemented by qtPrintFramework.
    
    Currently, Qt PDF file printer driver is the only non-native one.
    
    The Qt PDF file printer:
    - not necessary on OSX since OSX natively offers print to PDF
    - necessary on Win if you need that capability, but it cannot be integrated with the native Win Print dialog
    - is partially used on Linux by Qt (is visible in Qt Print dialog but QPageSetupDialog fails.)
    
    In other words, if you pass a non-native QPrinter (outputFormat == PDF):
          QPrintDialog  QPageSetupDialog
    OSX:   fail          fail
    Win:   fail          fail
