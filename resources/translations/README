To refresh translations:
>cd to this directory
>pylupdate5 qtPrintFramework.pro
(updates .ts files.)
>linguist
(open the .ts files and translate them)
>lrelease qtPrintFramework.pro
(generates new .qm files.)

(?lrelease5)

Now refresh the using apps resources
(which should include the .qm files from qtPrintFramework).
qtPrintFramework has a .qrc file (unused except as documentation.)
