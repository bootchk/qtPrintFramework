A.  Page setup remembered between app sessions for paperless printer

(Note that a system with a printer always remembers a real printer as the current printer?
Such a system will not let you set a paperless printer as the default printer?)

On a system with no printer (say a Linux box):
1. Start app
2. Choose Print
  _ dialog offers only 'Print to PDF'
3. Change paper of printer to (Legal, Landscape)
4. Choose OK
  _ (a real app) creates file
5. Quit and restart app
6. Choose PageSetup
  _ shows the paperless printer PageSetup dialog
  _ dialog show choices made above (Legal, Landscape) from previous session
  
 
B. Page setup for paperless printer remembered between File>Print invocations

C. File>Page Setup displays dialog for both real printers and paperless printers

D. File>Print PDF on Win platform

E. PageSetup shows correct PaperSize chosen in native dialogs (Qt Bug before 5.3)
