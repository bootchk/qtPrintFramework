A.  Page setup remembered between app sessions for paperless printer

(Note that a system with a printer always remembers a real printer as the current printer?
Such a system will not let you set a paperless printer as the default printer?)

On a system with no printer (say a Linux box):
1. Start app
2. Choose Print
  _ dialog offers only 'Print to PDF'
3. Change paper of printer to (Legal, Landscape)
4. Choose OK
  _ (a real app) creates file
5. Quit and restart app
6. Choose PageSetup
  _ shows the paperless printer PageSetup dialog
  _ dialog show choices made above (Legal, Landscape) from previous session
  
 
B. Page setup for paperless printer remembered between File>Print invocations

C. File>Page Setup displays dialog for both real printers and paperless printers

D. File>Print PDF on Win platform

E. PageSetup shows correct PaperSize chosen in native dialogs (Qt Bug before 5.3)

F. Cannot choose custom paper size on paperless printer

(A paperless printer, since it is all algorithm and no molecules, 
could print any paper size you could dream of.
But a paperless printer doesn't remember a choice of a range of custom paper sizes.
Choosing 'Custom' might really mean 'let me specify a paper size.'
It doesn't mean 'I have bought a special paper that I want this printerless file to understand.'
But there is little real user benefit of offering that choice:
since the paperless document is scaleable, users can view it at any size.
There is no point in referencing it to a paper size that other viewers won't understand.
So this framework does not attempt to tell a paperless printer a custom paper size.)
