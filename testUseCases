A.  Page setup remembered between app sessions for paperless printer

(Note that a system with a printer always remembers a real printer as the current printer?
Such a system will not let you set a paperless printer as the default printer?)

On a system with no printer (say Linux):
  1. Start app
  2. Choose Print
    _ dialog offers only one choice for printer: 'Print to File (PDF)'
  3. Change paper of printer to (Legal, Landscape)
  4. Choose OK
    _ PDF file is created with Legal, Landscape paper
  5. Quit and restart app
  6. Choose PageSetup
    _ shows the paperless printer PageSetup dialog
    _ dialog show choices made above (Legal, Landscape) from previous session
  
 
B. Page setup for paperless printer remembered between File>Print invocations

C. File>Page Setup displays dialog for both real printers and paperless printers

D. File>Print PDF on Win platform

E. PageSetup shows correct PaperSize chosen in native dialogs (Qt Bug before 5.3)


F. Cannot choose Custom paper in Page Setup on paperless printer
  1. Choose File>Print, choose PDF printer, specify a Custom paper, and print
  2. Choose File>Page Setup
    _ Get a warning: "Current paper is Custom.  Please setup another paper, or ..."
  3. Choose OK
    _ Warning closes
    _ 'Page Setup PDF' dialog opens
    _ 'Custom' is NOT a choice for 'Size'
  4.  Choose 'Cancel'
    _ current paper is still Custom
  5. Repeat 1-3 but then select 'A4' paper and choose 'OK'
    _ current paper is 'A4'
   


G. Custom paper of negative or zero size
  1. Choose File>Print
    _ dialog appears
  2. Choose 'Print to File (PDF)' (which has a Custom paper.)
  3. Choose 'Properties'
  4. Select 'Custom' paper
    _ Width and height boxes are enabled (Fails on Qt< 5.2?)
  5. Enter zero for width and height, enter a positive number for margins
  6. Choose 'Print' button
    _ Warning "Printable page is too small.." appears
    _ Nothing is printed
