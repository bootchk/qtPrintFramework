qtPrintFramework

Work in progress.

This is a framework that wraps the Qt print architecture.

It includes a small test app.

It is useful for:
- a working component of an app
- understanding the Qt print architecture.
- testing Qt print on different platforms that Qt supports.

Contributes (hides these warts):
- Qt's QPrintDialog and QPageSetupDialog cannot be used for non-native printer, some platforms
- the Win platform has no native support for printing PDF
- Qt versions before 5.3 return wrong PaperSize on OSX Bug TODO

These warts are not necessarily the fault of Qt:
it is difficult to adapt the print architectures of diverse platforms.

Attributes:
- use cases work on all platforms
- i18n (TODO)

Use cases (GUI test sequences):
- print to PDF file on all platforms
	- OSX: Implemented by OSX
	- Linux: Implemented by Qt inside QPrintDialog
	- Win: Implemented by this framework, using Qt modules TODO
- PageSetup if no physical print device on system ( Paperless printer only.)
- remembers current printer (may be Paperless printer: PDF or XPS) ???
- remembers PageSetup of current printer if Paperless
- PageSetup is a setting of the app, and is applied on app startup to Paperless printer only.

TODO explain this: I inconsistently call a NonNative printer a Paperless printer, meaning only 'no cellulose'
Qt's notion of a NonNative printer is: native platform has no interaction with printer (typically PDF on Win)
OR some Qt dialog (typically QPageSetupDialog on Linux) refuse to work with it.
A NonNative printer is typically cellulose free, but has pages and pagination (PDF.)
But some native printers (i.e. Win XPS) are also cellulose free.
