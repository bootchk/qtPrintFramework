qtPrintFramework

Released under license GPLv3



This is a framework that wraps the Qt print architecture.

It includes a small test app.

It is useful for:
- as a working component of an app
- understanding the Qt print architecture.
- testing Qt print on different platforms that Qt supports.

Contributes (hides these warts):
- Qt's QPrintDialog and QPageSetupDialog cannot be used for non-native printer
- the Win platform has no native support for printing PDF

These warts are not necessarily the fault of Qt:
it is difficult to adapt the print architectures of diverse platforms.

Attributes:
- use cases work on all platforms
- i18n

Use cases (GUI test sequences):
- print to PDF file on all platforms
	- OSX: Implemented by OSX
	- Linux: Implemented by Qt inside QPrintDialog
	- Win: Implemented by this framework, using Qt modules
- PageSetup if no physical print device on system
- app remembers current printer (may be Paperless printer: PDF or XPS)
- app remembers PageSetup for current printer
