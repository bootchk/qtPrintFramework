qtPrintFramework

Work in progress.

This is a framework that wraps the Qt print architecture.

It includes a small test app.

It is useful for:
- a working component of an app
- understanding the Qt print architecture.
- testing Qt print on different platforms that Qt supports.

Contributes
-----------

 Hides these warts:
- Qt's QPrintDialog and QPageSetupDialog cannot be used for non-native printer, some platforms
- the Win platform has no native support for printing PDF
- Qt versions before 5.3 return wrong PaperSize on OSX Bug TODO
- native print dialog lets user specify an invalid Custom paper (too small to print.)

These warts are not necessarily the fault of Qt:
it is difficult to adapt the print architectures of diverse platforms.

This framework also encapsulates a print subsystem.
It emits print-related signals.

This framework does NOT let user specify Custom paper for PDF.
(Qt is still too buggy for that.)
The native print dialog of Qt, in some versions, still shows that:
when user chooses Custom for a PDF printer, the height and width boxes are disabled
and the dialog returns an empty page size.


GUI considerations for PageSetup
--------------------------------

Having a PageSetup action (separate from a Print action) is discouraged by some designers.
(For example, the Apple HIG discourages it.)
Yet some users want the flexibility to PageSetup before Print.
Many apps may show a page.  A user may want to configure the page before printing.
If a Print dialog does not let you apply page changes without printing,
then users are forced to print (to trash) just to change page attributes.




Attributes:
- use cases work on all platforms
- i18n (TODO)

Use cases (GUI test sequences):
- print to PDF file on all platforms
	- OSX: Implemented by OSX
	- Linux: Implemented by Qt inside QPrintDialog
	- Win: Implemented by this framework, using Qt modules TODO
- PageSetup if no physical print device on system ( Paperless printer only.)
- remembers current printer (may be Paperless printer: PDF or XPS) ???
- remembers PageSetup of current printer if Paperless
- PageSetup is a setting of the app, and is applied on app startup to Paperless printer only.

TODO explain this: I inconsistently call a NonNative printer a Paperless printer, meaning only 'no cellulose'
Qt's notion of a NonNative printer is: native platform has no interaction with printer (typically PDF on Win)
OR some Qt dialog (typically QPageSetupDialog on Linux) refuse to work with it.
A NonNative printer is typically cellulose free, but has pages and pagination (PDF.)
But some native printers (i.e. Win XPS) are also cellulose free.
